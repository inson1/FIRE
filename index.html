				<h1>Financial Independence, Retire Early</h1>
				<hr/>
				<h2>What is financial independence?</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Financial independence</strong> is having enough wealth such that you no longer have to work for money. You become financially independent when your wealth's assets produce enough income to cover your expenses.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>For example</strong>: If you have $500,000 in assets and your assets produce $20,000 per year (4% of your total assets value) and your expenses for the year are $20,000 or less, then congratulations, you are now financially independent. Your assets are producing more income than you spend in a year.
				</p>
				<h3>But that's not enough money to live!</h3>
				<p>
					Everyone has a different <strong>financial independence number</strong>. Some people want to have a more lavish retirement and therefore will need to save more money. Some people want to retire as soon as possible and are more willing to cut back some expenses. The key to financial independence is <em>how much money you spend</em>. The more you spend, the more you will need to save. The less you spend, the less you will need to save.
				</p>
				<h3>How much money do I really need to save in order to retire?</h3>
				<p>
					You need to save at least 25 times your annual spending.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Why?</strong> In 1998, three professors at Trinity University released what is now called the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study'>Trinity study</a>. The study looked at a number of different stock/bond mixes of portfolios and their withdrawal rates from 1925 to 1995 in periods of 15 to 30 years. The study concluded that if you withdrew no more than 3-4% of your investment portfolio every year, then it would be extremely unlikely that your portfolio would run out of money. Thus, from this study, 4% became known as the <strong>safe withdrawal rate</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, withdrawing 4% of your investment portfolio every year should cover your annual expenses. Since this is 1/25 of your portfolio, then as a general rule, your portfolio must be at least 25 times your annual spending in order to retire.
				</p>
				<h3>But is that really enough money?</h3>
				<p>
					Some people might be more conservative and go with a 3% withdrawal rate. That decision is up to you. However, keep in mind that the Trinity study did not assume the following:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Adding more money to your portfolio:
						<ul>
							<li>Continuing to work during retirement, such as an enjoyable side job or hobby</li>
							<li>Getting money from Social Security, Medicare, pensions or other windfalls</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Reductions to annual withdrawals:
						<ul>
							<li>Spending less money when the markets are down</li>
							<li>Spending less money as you get older</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					With some of these assumptions in place, we do not have to be so conservative with our safe withdrawal rate and can use the standard 4% safe withdrawal rate.
				</p>
				<h3>How long does it take to reach financial independence?</h3>
				<p>
					An important factor to financial independence is your <strong>savings rate</strong>, which is how much of your income you can save. The more you save, the quicker you will reach financial independence. Take a look at Mr. Money Mustache's article on <a href='http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/'>The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement</a>. Assuming a net worth of zero, if you save 50% of your income, you can retire in 17 years. If you save 75%, you can retire in 7 years. If you can save 85%, you can retire in 4 years.
